### I know the struggles
For most of my life I participated in sports and exercised regularly.  I never had problems with my weight or health until my late 30’s.  At that point the number on the scale started creeping up, in spite of being active.  I thought I had a healthy diet.  For the most part, I ate well, based on the Standard American Diet guidelines.

### I created a lifestyle change
However, by following these Standard American Diet guidelines and some in between meal snacks, my weight kept going up. In July 2017, I decided to focus on my diet, because I could not out exercise bad eating.  I started on a Ketogenic diet and the weight started falling off. 

### I immersed myself in a wealth of knowledge
I decided to research and engulf myself in podcasts regarding how one’s diet affects one’s weight and health. My eyes were opened to a whole new lifestyle, which included what I ate, my exercise and daily activities, sleep and my state of mind.

### I became a resource
I learned so much that I wanted to share it with anyone who was interested in making positive changes in their health.  This brought me to my decision to obtain my health coach certificate.

### We can work together
With my experience and knowledge, I can work with you to provide the blueprint to your new healthy lifestyle. Like all major changes, it will be hard, but I will be there with you every step along the way.
