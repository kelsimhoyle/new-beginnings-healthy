  For most of my life I participated in sports and exercised regularly.  I never had problems with my weight or health until my late 30’s.  At that point the number on the scale started creeping up, in spite of being active.  I thought I had a healthy diet.  For the most part, I ate well, based on the Standard American Diet guidelines. However, by following these guidelines and some in between meal snacks, by weight kept going up. In July 2017, I decided to focus on my diet, because I could not out exercise bad eating.  I started on a Ketogenic diet and the weight started falling off.  I decided to research and engulf myself in podcasts regarding how one’s diet affects one’s weight and health. My eyes were opened to a whole new lifestyle, which included what I ate, my exercise and daily activities, sleep and my state of mind. I learned so much that I wanted to share it with anyone who was interested in making positive changes in their health.  This brought me to my decision to obtain my health coach certificate.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
